# snake game

## 🥺 TODO List (in order of priority)
- host on github pages
- touch control (for now it only works with keyboard)
- settings menu
- dynamic color schemes
- the background should be full screen 
- translations (maybe)
- write tests (maybe)
- show a score and a highscore etc.
- rebuild background on resize
- while a key is pressed, pressing another key should change direction
- pressing a key should make the snake move faster
- blur background (the little space that is not covered by the blocks)
- make the snake lose before moving out of the screen
- add joystick support :D

## 😏 DONE List 
- add points that snake eats, and increase snake length and speed 
- movement control: should only by able to go 90 degrees at a time, e.g. up -> left -> down -> right -> up -> etc. or vice versa
- fix restart
